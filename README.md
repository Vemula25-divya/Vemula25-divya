# ML-Driven Pipelines for Drug Discovery

This repository contains machine learning and computational chemistry workflows developed for predicting small-molecule inhibitors, analyzing protein-ligand interactions, and integrating molecular dynamics with AI models. It reflects ongoing research from my PhD work at NIPER Hyderabad. It is tailored to real-world drug discovery applications including antimicrobial resistance, cryptic pocket identification, and structure-based lead optimization.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ About Me

I am Divya Vemula, a PhD research scholar specializing in pharmacoinformatics with a focus on infectious disease drug discovery. My expertise includes:

- Structure- and ligand-based virtual screening
- Molecular docking & dynamics (Schr√∂dinger, Desmond, OpenMM)
- ML/AI model development using RDKit, scikit-learn, and PyTorch
- Integration of omics and structural data to identify novel drug targets
